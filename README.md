<p align="center">I am interested in becoming a front end web developer, drawing on both my technical and creative skills.</p> 
</br> 

<h2>About me</h2>

I graduated in 2019 with a first class degree in Business Management. Whilst this enabled me to understand many traditional business models, the impact of digital and tech on the majority of sectors was of real  interest to me. In my final year I joined the University marketing team, working across a number of digital campaigns, and  building expertise in creative web development. As a result of this I started to teach myself HTML and CSS, gaining  a wider interest in software development as this could be applied to so many fields.  

Advancing my coding skills further, I taught myself Ruby, reinforcing and testing my knowledge via Code-wars, and went on to apply to the selective Makers Coding bootcamp. In addition to hard coding skills, the course was based on problem solving as part of a team, with focus on developing clean and efficient code. In my final team project we chose to deploy a tech stack which was new to us combined with a new front end, React Navigate. This approach enabled me to deliver a cohesive and well presented mobile format , iOS, trialled in X code, and  bringing  together my creative skills and coding knowledge.     

I would like to work in an environment that challenges me to advance  web development, and shares  my goal  of creating the ultimate user experience. Having graduated from Makers I am keen to use my tenacity, curiosity and developing tech skills to achieve this.

<h2>Experience</h2> 

<dl>  
  <dt>Social Media and Brand Communication</dt> 
  <b><dd>Solent University(2018-2019)</dd></b>  
  <dd> 
  I have gained valuable skills and experience in strategic planning for social media campaigns directed at students. To manage the social media accounts I learnt how to use the Hootsuite platform to schedule daily posts and find relevant topics relating to Solent University activities.  Furthermore,  I created digital media in the form of images, short videos and gif’s to improve user engagement.  Moreover,  I was given the responsibility of creating an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/solentunialumni/?hl=en">Solent alumna instagram</a> account with the purpose of sharing upcoming events and achievements may bypass students. The account now has over 1000 followers and  continues to grow.  In addition,  both the Facebook and Twitter accounts saw a 15% increase in the number of followers. Overall,  this experience has been fundamental in growing my interest in digital media  and web development.</dd> 
 <dd> Another responsibility was processing new Solent alumni  who wanted to engage in the universities activities  and social programs. This involved inputting applicants names into a database  while crosschecking there details with the universities registry.  </dd>

<h2>Skills</h2> 

<dl>
  <dt>Problem Solving</dt> 
  <dd>When confronting a new problem I engage with it in stages,  by establishing where the issue is coming from and how it is occurring. Then I applying research and existing knowledge knowledge  to construct a plan in which to deal with the matter.   This approach is highly effective when dealing with bugs any project. </dd> 
  <dt>Quick Learner</dt> 
  <dd>I learn through experimenting with new concepts  in order to get a clear idea of the subject matter at hand.  While working at Solent’s University communications department,  I quickly learned how to use a database called C2C which manage alumni’s private information. As a result the manager assigned me more responsibilities over the collection and  storage of personal data.</dd>  
  <dt> Resilient </dt> 
  <dd> In my past work experience, I had a temporary summer job working at the Epsom Royal Automobile Club (RAC) as a waiter. Due to the popularity of the on-site restaurant,  I often had to manage multiple responsibilities to make sure everything ran smoothly,  this would often include; bar work,  overseeing new employees and  overseeing the host desk.</dd> 
  <dt> Strong Organisation </dt> 
  <dd> During my studies at Makers coding Academy, we were given new topics to learn every week which would coincide with afternoon and weekend challenges.  To effectively learn these subjects  I would create a timetable for that week  so each  theme could be learnt on a different day. </dd>

<h2>Education</h2> 

<dl> 
 <dt>Makers Coding bootcamp (2020 - 2021)</dt>  
  <dd>The Makers coding Boot Camp pre-course started with learning the fundamentals of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> through challenges which focused on different aspects of the code. This enabled me to understand the language more proficiently when it came to applying these concepts to my projects.</dd> 
  
  <dd>  I learned to implement the testing framework <a href="https://rspec.info/">Rspec</a> alongside the practice of test-driven development (TDD). This greatly assisted me in the debugging of my projects, as I was able to plan and reflect my code appropriately for  testing.  I would apply this process later to JavaScript with the testing framework Jasmine.  </dd>  
  
  <dd>Introduced to the design of the model-view-controller(MVC), enabling me to understand  areas in which a web application functions to both the user,the programmer,  and in regard to the front and back end. Further new areas of practice applied to databases (SQL), frameworks such as Sinatra, and expanding my coding languages with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">HTML5</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/">CSS3</a>.</dd>  
  
  <dd>My first independent group project  bought together all of the recently covered topics with the challenge of building a web application similar to AirBnB. This introduced the concept of a minimum-viable-product’s (MVPs), which was important for demonstrating the core application use  and how it would function. For effective communication, we  scheduled morning and afternoon meetings via  Zoom, to discussed the functions that had been implemented and tested, and to discuss our progress and challenges. When implementing new features we paired to focus on task completion. In addition we regularly communicated through  Slack group, to keep proactively up to date on  issues or concerns which occurred. Furthermore, domain-driven design (DDD) was utilised to label  the classes,  variables and methods aligned with  the business domain. </dd> 
  
 <dd>Learning <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> with the application's of <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">jasmine</a> as a testing framework and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for styling.     
 With no prior knowledge of the language this greatly assisted me in  understanding the new syntaxes used in the code.</dd> 
 
 <dd> A significant  group project, was to utilise the framework Rails to build an application similar to Twitter. With no one in the team having prior experience of  using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">rails</a>, wefirst mocked together to research  how to set up the application appropriately. Once this had been achieved we established our MVP alongside agreeing and allocating  team  responsibilities to research how to implement functions in rails. A Trello board and Github wiki were  used to track of these activities and monitor  at  what stage they were being implemented e.g. being completed, ready for review and implemented. We unanimously decided as a team to take on the challenge of using React to give our app single-page front-end functionality. This was an important group decision as it challenged us to use a new the  JavaScript library.  </dd> 
 
 <dd>My team and I were  subsequently challenged on another  project to build a notepad application using JavaScript vanilla for both testing and styling. This had greatly challenge me in researching the topic of vanilla JavaScript and applying it to the group project, which I did successfully. 
 </dd> 
 
 <dd>In my final group project,  the task was to create an application targeting  travellers. Each team member presented ideas, as a group we agreed on an approach, to create an app which would give travellers real time and location specific information  without needing to access multiple browsers. To manage our group workflow throughout the two weeks,  we used Github’s project board. We also challenged ourselves to use new languages and libraries. Therefore, we decided to build a travel app in iOS’s  operating system utilising the tech stack <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>,  <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>,  <a href="https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/fireball.html">Fireball</a> and <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. Utilising  Wireframe application to lay out a user-friendly design designed to simplify and encourage user engagement. This was innovative learning for the group, and the first time useful  laying out an application in a smart phone format. To run the app in an iOS format we utilised <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo Go</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> simulators. The utilisation of application programming interface (API’s) was applied and regularly updated to provide accurate information to the user. Unfortunately, due to API constraints in cost and time,  we were unable to implement all Apis. Further development would have seen more APIs.</dd>
